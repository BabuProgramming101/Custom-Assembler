Q1) What do you observe after posting HTML?

After posting the HTML, such that I included the underline tag with my post (i.e <u>DESCRIPTION OF POST</u>), I noticed that after sending the post, the entire post gets underlined as a result. This is due to the fact that the implementation of this twitter clone does not filter HTML syntax. As a result, whatever HTML syntax that is embedded with your post will change the content of the post such that it reflects the HTML syntax. 

Q2) What do you observe after posting the Javascript alert box?

After posting the JS alert box and pressing send, I noticed that when I went back to the page where it displays all of your tweets, before the site shows all of the tweets, an alert modal appears on the top of the page with the description of the content you put inside the alert parameter. The user would then have to click ok to close the alert modal. Upon doing so, you are then finally shown all of your messages. However, when looking at the recent message, there is no message content displayed (most likely empty string), which is still considered as a message. In addition, every time you visit the empty message, the alert modal will constantly appear. 

Q3) What is the name of the vulnerability you have uncovered?

Because this twitter clone allows users to inject both markup and scripts, the name of the vulernability that occurs is known as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
